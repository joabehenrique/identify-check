## ‚òï Using Identify Check

To use Identify Check, follow these steps:

```
The project is a challenge for a MaxMilhas practical test, it 
consists of a control of CPFs in a spreadsheet. In this spreadsheet 
are added CPFs with risk of fraud. With the increase in our customer 
base, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain manual control.

With this in mind, the team's Product Owner raised the main functional 
requirements for the development of a system to control the CPFs by adding 
them to a restricted list.These requirements were implemented by me in the 
solution for this project. 
```
Getting a cpf
```
(GET) api/v1/cpf/{cpf}
```
Getting all cpf 
```
(GET) api/v1/cpf
```
Deleting a cpf
```
(DELETE) api/v1/cpf/{cpf}
```
Creating a cpf
